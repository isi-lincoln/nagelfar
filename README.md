### Additions

No changes to the core code.  This repository is used to verify the tcl being sent to emulab-based testbeds, such as deterlab (https://www.isi.deterlab.net/index.php).

This particular repository was designed to verify the tcl being generated by ISI's graph generator (https://github.com/ISIEdgeLab/graphGen) which is used to build a topology (via an ns/tcl file), and create a click template to seed to click to implement the topology.
